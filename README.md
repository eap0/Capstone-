This repository is for the Fall 2022 Erdos institute capstone project "Mortality" by
Kirsten Casey,
Lauren Ennesser, and 
Ethel Perez

Our aim is to find identify predictors of high deathrates in US counties.
We use data from the US Census, US Department of Labor, and EPA to study the deathrates
of US counties for different races, genders, and age groups, and compare these to air quality
measurements and poverty rates.

We assume you have an Anaconda package manager that includes numpy, matplotlib, and other standard
python packages.

To install:
<code>pip install -e .</code>

Other package dependencies: <br>
plotly: https://plotly.com/python/ <br>
corner: https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/

Once downloaded, you'll need to unzip the main data spreadsheet: <br>
mort_with_15yrpoverty.csv.zip

Notebooks used to make plots are located in the "Notebooks" directory.
