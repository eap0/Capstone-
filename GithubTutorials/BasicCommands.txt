|Adding Files To Your Branch|
|___________________________|

First, stage the files you want to add to your commit:
> git add filename.file

Optionally, check what is on your stage:
> git status

Create your commit:
> git commit -m "commit message"
The commit message should be as short and descriptive as you can make
it. Good examples: "Changed default blinding strategy" "removed lingering 
references to FIBER" Bad example: "updated branch"

Push all your staged commits to your branch on the repo:
> git push

__________________
|Updating the repo|
|_________________|

When you have a feature or file that you want everyone to share, you'll 
want to add that to the "main" branch! To move something from your repo
branch to "main", you'll need to submit a "pull request". Make an
announcment on Slack, and the others can reveiw & approve it. Once 
approved, we'll all need to "pull" the new version of the repo:

> git pull

This will check for changes to all the branches on the repo, and overwrite
files you have not changed locally. If there are differences between your
local version and the current github version, you'll get a message asking 
for you to either commit or "stash" your changes. You'll want to commit 
anything you want to save, and stash what you want to trash.

|Branch Basics|
|_____________|

Create a new branch (locally):
> git checkout -b newbranchname

Upload your branch to the repo:
> git push origin newbranchname

Switch to a different branch:
> git checkout branchname

Check which branch you're on (will open in a text editor window):
> git branch 
type "q" to quit the text editor
