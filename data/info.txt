Air Quality Columns

CO 8-hr 2nd Max
For Carbon Monoxide, the 2nd highest non-overlapping 8-hour average in the year.

The greatest sources of CO to outdoor air are cars, trucks and other vehicles or machinery that burn fossil fuels.

NO2 Annual Mean
For Nitrogen Dioxide, the annual mean of all the 1-hour measurements in the year.

NO2 primarily gets in the air from the burning of fuel. NO2 forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment.

O3 8-hr 4th Max
For Ozone, the 4th highest daily max 8-hour average in the year.

Tropospheric, or ground level ozone, is not emitted directly into the air, 
but is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and 
volatile organic compounds (VOC). This happens when pollutants emitted by 
cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, chemical plants, and 
other sources chemically react in the presence of sunlight.

SO2 Annual Mean
For Sulfur Dioxide, the annual mean of all the 1-hour measurements in the year.

The largest source of SO2 in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels by 
power plants and other industrial facilities. Smaller sources of SO2 emissions 
include: industrial processes such as extracting metal from ore; natural sources 
such as volcanoes; and locomotives, ships and other vehicles and heavy equipment 
that burn fuel with a high sulfur content.

PM2.5 Wtd Mean
For PM2.5, the Weighted Annual Mean (mean weighted by calendar quarter) for the year. 
(Note: PM2.5 data reported as parameter 88502 are not included in this summary report. 
Only federal reference method PM2.5 data reported as parameter 88101  are included in this report.) 

These particles come in many sizes and shapes and can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals.
Some are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.
Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of complex reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and 
nitrogen oxides, which are pollutants emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles.

Lead Max 3-Mo Avg
For Lead, the maximum of all rolling 3-month averages in the year.

At the national level, major sources of lead in the air are ore and metals processing 
and piston-engine aircraft operating on leaded aviation fuel. Other sources are waste 
incinerators, utilities, and lead-acid battery manufacturers. The highest air 
concentrations of lead are usually found near lead smelters.
